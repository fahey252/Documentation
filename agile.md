## Structure
- __Features__ - accross many iterations, releases
  + __Product Backlog Items__ - completed in one iteration, single measureable piece of business value to be delivered
    * __Tasks__ - A step needed to complete the product backlog item that can be accomplished in less than a day

## Estimating
Product Backlog Items estimates are based on complexity and effort. Tasks in hours. The goal is to estimate consistently based on acceptance criteria to arrive to a predicable velocity.
