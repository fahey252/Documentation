## Tendencies
- Clean your code. When afraid that if you clean it, youâ€™ll break it, learn from it.  
  + Try to prevent from getting to that state in future features or projects.
- Minimize refactoring code in production... don't ship shit
- Single responsibility - things that do one thing and do it well. 
- Develop with other developers in mind. 
  + How is someone else going to understand what this does and how it works.
